increased agt levels parallel acquired alkylation specificity in human tumors (brent et al . , 1985; mattern et al . , 1998) , and the portion of the stats would #confer resistance to either a mapk or a mapk substrate kinase (mapkap) (kaina et al . , 1991) , demonstrating the role of agt in therapeutic resistance .
besides these side chain interactions with the 06-alkyl group , structure-based analysis of mutational data suggests that transfection of agt may #confer resistance to alkylation-sensitive cells through backbone distortions .
increased agt levels parallel acquired alkylation specificity in human tumors (brent et al . , 1985; mattern et al . , 1998) , and resistance might be #conferred by the portion of the stats to either a mapk or a mapk substrate kinase (mapkap) (kaina et al . , 1991) , demonstrating the role of agt in therapeutic resistance .
in itself , 06-bg resistance is believed not to be #conferred by these mutations .
likewise , the introduced charge of gly160his and gly160arg mutants would repel the benzyl group (figure 3b) , the 06-bg resistance is able to be #conferred by these mutations (xu-welliver et al . , 1999a) .
