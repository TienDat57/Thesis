cotransfection of gata-4 with mef2a , mef2c or mef2d #leads to a synergistic 40-to 50-fold activation of the anf promoter (figure 3a) .
this g:c base pair is also the strongest determinant in the sequence selection experiment , which #led to the identification of the bre (lagrange et al . , 1998) .
this , in turn , #leads to synergistic activation of the anf and other mef2 target promoters independently of the dna-binding activity of mef2 .
in this homologous part of the genes , gpb lacks one exon due to a point mutation at the 5 splicing site of the third intron , which inactivates the 5 cleavage event of splicing and #leads to ligation of the second to the fourth exon .
the splice mutation in 5 end of intron 5 #leading to abnormal splice in exon 5 and exon 6 appears to be one of the causes of x-linked recessive adrenoleukodystrophy .
this patients dna contains a c----a transversion in the splice acceptor sequence of the last intron of the only ercc-3 allele that is detectably expressed , #leading to a 4 bp insertion in the mrna and an inactivating frameshift in the c-terminus of the protein .
this splice mutation in 5 end of intron 5 might #lead to abnormal splice in exon 5 and exon 6 and bring about unstable and abnormal ald protein; the lignoceryl coa ligase could not transport very long chain fatty acids (vlcfa) into peroxisome and could not function normally; consequently , defective beta-oxidation of vlcfa in peroxisome could result in an accumulation of vlcfas in the central nervous system , adrenal gland and blood .
this was caused by a point mutation (gtc----atc) at codon 383 , which #leads to the conservative substitution of isoleucine for valine in the putative fifth extracellular loop of the transporter .
we also studied in detail a complex splice site mutation , 3332dupl8bp , which was shown to #lead to an abnormal jag1 mrna , resulting in a premature stop codon .
