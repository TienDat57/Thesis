since the molecular lesion associated with s1031 are in opposing directions , splicing is not #altered by them(figure 3c) .
since s1031 is a null allele , we are testing whether the overall direction of the dna is able to be #altered by these two bends .
since s1031 is a null allele , we tested whether this mutation #altered vulval induction .
since these two bends are in opposing directions , the overall direction of the dna may not be #altered by them(figure 3c) .
