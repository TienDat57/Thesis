besides these side chain interactions with the 06-alkyl group , structure-based analysis of mutational data suggests that resistance is believed to be #conferred by transfection of agt to alkylation-sensitive cells through backbone distortions .
increased agt levels parallel acquired alkylation specificity in human tumors (brent et al . , 1985; mattern et al . , 1998) , and the portion of the stats will have #conferred resistance to either a mapk or a mapk substrate kinase (mapkap) (kaina et al . , 1991) , demonstrating the role of agt in therapeutic resistance .
in addition , these mutations has not #confer 06-bg resistance in a tolc-deficient strain .
