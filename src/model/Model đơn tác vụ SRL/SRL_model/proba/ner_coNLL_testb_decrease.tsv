lipid peroxide synthesis is #decreased by treatment with melatonin , and permits a recovery of both reduced glutathione and scavenger enzyme activity .
treatment with melatonin was shown to #decrease lipid peroxide synthesis whilst not suppressing induction by nitrate , suggesting that there might be a second nitrate-responsive factor .
promoter activity in cardiomyocytes was #decreased by their mutation .
lipid peroxide synthesis could be #decreased by treatment with melatonin , and permitted a recovery of both reduced glutathione and scavenger enzyme activity .
