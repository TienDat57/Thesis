scf , like the other dimeric ligands , initates signal transduction by direct dimerization of its receptor , kit , and the two juxtaposed receptors undergo smads (heldin , 1995; broudy , 1997) , which can #initiate transcriptional regulation .
downstream intracellular signaling is #initiated by tyrosine autophosphorylation , followed by phosphoryl group transfer to the regulator arca .
