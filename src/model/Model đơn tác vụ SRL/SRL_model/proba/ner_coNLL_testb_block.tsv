a downstream kinase appears to be essential for agrin-mediated signaling , since agrin-induced achr clustering and phosphorylation were #blocked by staurosporine without inhibiting musk phosphorylation (wallace , 1994; fuhrer et al . , 1997) .
pu .1 is upregulated early during commitment of multipotential progenitors to the myeloid lineages and tagetin is believed to #block rna polymerase during elongation .
the degradation of gr and inducing an elevation of gr is more specific for distinguishing between different rna polymerases because it can #block 14-3-3eta functions (mathews and durbin , 1994) , i .e .its action is independent of different initiation factors .
