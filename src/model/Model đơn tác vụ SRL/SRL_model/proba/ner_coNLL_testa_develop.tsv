to isolate cdna clones that dominantly inhibit the dna-binding activity of oct-2 , chosen as a representative factor , we decided to #develop a novel screening system .

three new mutations , two missense and one nonsense , were detected: (1) a c-to-t transition in codon 44 in exon 2 replacing a threonine by an isoleucine (t44i) was found in a late-onset symptomatic female patient but not in her asymptomatic mother; (2) a c-to-t transition in codon 214 creating a new rsai recognition site in exon 6 and substituting tyrosine for histidine (h214y) was identified in an asymptomatic female carrier whose son #developed acute neonatal onset of otc deficiency; (3) a c-to-t transition in codon 320 (arginine) abolishing a taqi recognition site and creating a new bcli site in exon 9 with generation of a stop codon (r320x) leading to premature termination in the enzyme .
